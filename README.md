# Weather Redux App

## Clarification
This is additonal and simple Redux project covering tasks which were skipped while creation of primary Weather Create React application. Reason behind this was my desire to first start with React basics, develop the app and then integrate Redux. However, I found the job a bit difficult and considering the deadline I decided to add one more site which you can find a link to under the links section of this README.  

## A Weather App

Including completed tasks:

- Set up a React project and configure Redux for state management.
- Integrate the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data based on user input.
- Build user interface (UI) components, including a search bar and weather
display.
- Enhance user experience with visual representations of weather conditions.
